Plant Disease Diagnosis Concept
Plant Disease Diagnosis is an AI-driven web application designed to help farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts quickly identify and manage plant diseases. By leveraging decision-tree logic and a structured, symptom-based approach, the application guides users through the diagnosis process, offering clear treatment suggestions and preventive measures based on selected symptoms.

Features
- Symptom-based Diagnosis: Users select plant type and tick visible symptoms for a streamlined analysis.
  
- Decision Tree Logic: System intelligently narrows down potential diseases as symptoms are added.
  
-Treatment Suggestions: Provides actionable recommendations for disease management and prevention.

- Modular Design: Clean code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
  
Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Database: SQLite (initial), scalable to PostgreSQL
- AI Techniques: Decision Tree Logic (current), Machine Learning for image analysis (future)
